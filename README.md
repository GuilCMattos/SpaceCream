## ðŸš€ About me

Graduated in Cinema and Audiovisual until discovering that I love technology and its programming areas more.

After 4 years studying Cinema and Audiovisual, having worked as a video editor, migrating to the Marketing area, I discover that this is not exactly what I want in my life. Since I was a child passionate about technology and the like, today I see that this is the area I want for my life!

I'm currently studying Systems Analysis and Development at the Catholic University of Santos - UNISANTOS, and devouring content on HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, Node.

Enthusiast of agile methods, flexible environments and continuous delivery.

I find it easy to learn new tools and new work models, in order to adapt as soon as possible to offer good performance.
